# Daytona Browser extension

This is the browser extension for Daytona. It supports Chrome, Firefox and Edge, and adds a **Daytona** button to the configured GitLab, GitHub and Bitbucket installations (defaults to `gitlab.com`, `github.com`, `bitbucket.org`, and `gitlab.cn`) which immediately creates a Daytona workspace for the current Git context.
